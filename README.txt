The 3-4-5 Syzygy tablebases is a compact up-to-5 piece endgame database developed by Ronald de Man on Avril, 01 2013 (https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Ronald+de+Man).

This is the fundamental part of these tablebases to use. Months of testing have proven that 6 pieces and 7 pieces
are totally unuseful with the modern chess engines.

The integrity of this database has been checked this year by me and it has been approved. You can make the test yourself
just in case by double-clicking on the file check_integrity.bat inside the folder 3-4-5.
